## Smart devices, the good, the bad, and the middle ground
### 12.12.20

As you probably know I've been into technology for quite a long time, and like most people, I've looked into the idea of smart devices such as smart watches and other little interencted connected devices. I actually have a smart watch that I bought in July and here's my opinion on it... It's not that useful, and may even be a privacy risk, but it's also the perfect middle ground.

The smart watch I have has phsycial hands and a display, with all the features you'd expect from a basic smart watch. You get notifications from your phone, provided you have the app installed and connected via Bluetooth, and that's where the privay risk comes in. Android devices have a built-in feature called Bluetooth scanning, which sends logs of every Bluetooth device your phone comes into contact with to Google. This may not seem like a big deal, but it means you could be tracked without knowing and without being able to do anything about it.

As for it being useful or not, that's just a matter of my personal opinion, but if you have your phone with you anyway, you don't need to get notifications on your watch, and it might be nicer not to. The more I've used technology the more I've understood that it's important to take a break from it sometimes, like with all things.

However, I do think my particular smart watch is the perfect middle ground because of the following points:
- It has physical hands in additon to the display and smart watch features
- It can be used as a normal watch by turning off the smart watch portition, an offine smart watch by turning off Bluetooth, or a normal smart watch by keeping the smart watch portition and Bluetooth turned on.

I'm currently not using it too much since most of the places I go have clocks, or if not, I can just use my phone. But if I go or a school trip or would just like to go out without my phone, I'll use it as a normal watch, which works just fine for me.
