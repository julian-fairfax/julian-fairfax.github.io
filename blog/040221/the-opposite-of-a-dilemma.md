## The opposite of a dilemma
## 04.02.21

If you, like myself, are interested in the subject of privacy, then you've probably seen "The Social Dilemma", a film that explores the rise of social media and the damage it has caused to society. I'm going to be focusing on the films title here, which refers to the choice of using social media or not, as a dilemma. But is that the case with social media?

I don't think so. People have a lot of different reasons for using social media. The question is why should you keep using it? Most people feel they need social media in their lives because they've used it for so long. In fact, people who've left social media can experience the same effects as someone who's stopped using drugs.

There's a simple reason for this: social media is a drug, to your brain. The way drugs work is that your brain produces dopamine when you take them, much like when someone interacts with you on social media. Those actions are then more and more associated both with the dopamine response. This means that it becomes more and more difficult for you to stop using them, and when you do, you'll feel the effects of your brain missing that dopamine response that it was expecting.

You might think this is a good reason to keep using social media, but I think it only shows how much of a problem it is. When I left social media I felt the same effects, and sometimes I regretted my decision. But I now realise that was one of the best decisions I ever made. I don't think it's a dilemma, I think it's the opposite, and I hope more people realise that.
